## User Experience:
- The app begins with a title for the calculator, then a screen for the operations building, then a screen for the result, and finally the main buttons for the numbers and operation.
- When the user first opens the web app, he/she will find the calculator with the basic operations, if the user pressed a number then an operation type and another number, the app will print the operation at the first screen/container and then perform the result and print it at the second screen/container.
- The operation and the result will be saved in the local storage for the last operation you perform.
- The *C* button clears the operation screen and the result screen and removes them from the local storage.
- The *CE* button removes the last entry at the operations screen and doesn't do anything at the local storage, this is used to parse a number or operation that pressed by accident.
